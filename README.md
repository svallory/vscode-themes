# Alchemy Themes

**Author:** [Saulo Vallory](https://about.me/saulovallory)

Themes created for my personal use but feel free to use them. I'm Saulo Vallory, btw. They will tend to be dark, without bright colors, yet with a lot of different colors to color code many tokens

**Enjoy!**

## Magnetite Matte Dark

**A fusion of:**

- Workbench: Aura Dark
- Code: One Dark Pro
